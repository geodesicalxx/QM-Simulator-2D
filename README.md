# Quantum Mechanics in 2D
This WebGL program simulates the quantum mechanics of a single particle trapped inside a 2D box, 
where within the box the user is capable of redrawing new potential barriers. 

The simulation uses a method described in page 690 of An Introduction to Computer Simulation Methods
by Gould H. et al., which involves splitting the wavefunction into its real and imaginary components,
performing a half-step to advance the real component in time, then using these updated real values to update the imaginary part.

# Instructions
When you open the app, the first thing you will see is a box where the wavefunction resides.
Click anywhere on the box to make an initial wavefunction. The wavefunction will be represented as a bright and colourful blob, where its brightness and colour corresponds to its probability density and complex phase respectively.
To the left of the box are the GUI controls. These are:
- **show probability density** checkbox. Check this to visualize only the probability density of the wavefunction instead of its real and imaginary parts.
- **speed** slider. Change the number of time steps per each animation frame. The value is an upper bound.
- **Preset Potential** dropdown. Change the potential values inside the box using the preset options found here. The options are SHO (Simple Harmonic Oscillator), ISW (Infinite Square Well), and Double Slit. The default potential at the start is SHO.
- **mouse** dropdown. Use the mouse to either place a new wavefunction `new Î¨(x, y)` or redraw the current potential `Reshape V(x, y)`.
