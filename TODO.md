## Features I Wish To Have
 - [ ] Add vector potentials A such that H = (p - A(x, y))Â²/(2m) + V(x, y)
 - [ ] Add Text entry to initialize the wavefunction.
 - [ ] Implement potentials that explicitly depend on time, i.e. V(x, y, t)
 - [ ] View wavefunction in momentum space
 - [ ] Compute and visualize eigenstates for arbitrary potentials. Construct wavefunctions from their superpositions. Add a measure energy feature.
