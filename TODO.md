## Possible New Features

### Schrodinger Simulation
 - [ ] Include other numerical schemes.
 - [ ] Implement the 3-vector potential A.
 - [ ] Find a way to visually show expectation values such as \<x\> or \<v\>.
 - [ ] Add a text-based way to initialize the wavefunction.
 - [ ] View wavefunction in momentum space
 - [ ] Compute and visualize energy eigenstates for arbitrary potentials. Construct wavefunctions from their superpositions. Add a measure energy feature.

### Dirac Simulation
 - [ ] Include the 3-vector potential as well.
 - [ ] Add the ability to initialize the wavefunction in terms of a linear combination of the different spinor components.
